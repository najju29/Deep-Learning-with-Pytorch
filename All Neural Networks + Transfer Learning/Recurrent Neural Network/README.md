# Recurrent Neural Network + Transfer Learning
1. **Basic RNN:** It has info about how RNNs work and its practical implementation with PyTorch.
2. **LSTM and GRU:** All the theoretical stuff about these architectures and the need of them above RNNs. And not to forget about the practical Implementation.
